# Muji Hotel

A modern hotel booking platform built with Next.js, Sanity CMS, and Stripe for payments.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Security

This project maintains security best practices with regular dependency audits.

### Running Security Audits

```bash
# Quick summary of vulnerabilities by severity
npm run audit:summary

# Full audit report
npm run audit:full

# Check for moderate+ severity issues (recommended for CI/CD)
npm run audit:check
```

**Current Status:** ✅ No moderate, high, or critical vulnerabilities
